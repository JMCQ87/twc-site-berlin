## Tech Workers Coalition Berlin - Learning Club
Learning is central to workers' empowerment. Without knowledge on the complex world we operate in, we are prey to the interests of those who capitalize on exploitation. Tech Worker Coalition organizes regular sessions in the form of reading groups to read and discuss articles, books and pamphlets about a variety of topics that sit on the boundary between technology critique, politics, philosophy and sociology. The role of the Tech Worker, the possible strategies and the history of worker organizations are also targets to our work.

Agile: managerial control, empty ritual or a form of workers power?

Since its inception, Agile and agile methodologies have received a mix of love and hate from software developers. A multitude of opinions, voices and positions populate the debate. While Agile seems to be less and less adopted in IT because associated with empty rituals and disconnected from modern development needs, new methodologies born from the same ideas are starting to be used in other industries as a new form of production to better control workers.

This month we will read a collection of short articles that exemplify some of the voices that often reoccur in this debate. We also present as optional readings some more in-depth articles that try to map the state of Agile.

Readings:

[The agile software manifesto](https://agilemanifesto.org/)

[Agile is the new waterfall](https://medium.com/swlh/agile-is-the-new-waterfall-f7baef5d026d)

[The end of Agile](https://www.forbes.com/sites/cognitiveworld/2019/08/23/the-end-of-agile/)

[The Agile labor union](http://www.metareader.org/post/agile-labor-union.html)

[Agility for Anxiety Capitalism](https://phoebevmoore.wordpress.com/2018/01/29/agility-for-anxiety-capitalism/)

Optional:

[Back to the future: origins and directions of the ‚ÄúAgile Manifesto‚Äù](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s40411-018-0059-z)

## How to participate

The easiest way to participate is to just show up at the event having read the material for the given session.

If you want to have a more interactive experience though, we have a Slack group and a [Facebook event](https://www.facebook.com/events/1235638503299767/) in which we might publish some additional readings for the more passionate participants.
