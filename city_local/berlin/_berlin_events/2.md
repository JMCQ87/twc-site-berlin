## Tech Workers Coalition Berlin
Tech Workers have a lot of potential power to change society. Anyone who identifies as a _tech worker_ and is interested in learning how to build collective power or get involved in a campaign is welcome. Tech Workers are currently organising against gender pay gaps, workplace harassment, surveillance technologies, amongst other things. This document is an agenda item for the first meeting of Tech Workers Coalition Berlin.
