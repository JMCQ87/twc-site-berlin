## Tech Workers Coalition Berlin
Tech Workers have a lot of potential power to change society. Anyone who identifies as a _tech worker_ and is interested in learning how to build collective power or get involved in a campaign is welcome. Tech Workers are currently organising against gender pay gaps, workplace harassment, surveillance technologies, amongst other things. This document is an agenda item for the first meeting of Tech Workers Coalition Berlin.

A panel about _Tech Workers Movement_ was held earlier this month 10 June 2019 at Aquarium Am Südblock, featuring Logic Magazine co-founders [Ben Tarnoff](https://twitter.com/bentarnoff) and [Moira Weigel](moiragweigel).  Ben, who is also an organiser of the Boston chapter, will be present during the meeting.
